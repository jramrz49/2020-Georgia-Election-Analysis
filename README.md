The Data Cleaning.RMD file contains a lot of data cleaning steps at the start, but the end product is saved in the "Cleaned_Data" file. One can load that excel and skip all the preceding codes. The data cleaning file also includes a detailed description of each variable. 

Codes for graphs and plots can be found in the Analysis by Albert Yen.RMD file
